class Sudoku():
    """
    This class creates sudoku objects which can be used to solve sudokus. 
    A sudoku object can be any size grid, as long as the square root of the size is a whole integer.
    To indicate that a cell in the sudoku grid is empty we use a zero.
    A sudoku object is initialized with an empty grid of a certain size.

    Attributes:
        :param self.grid: The sudoku grid containing all the digits.
        :type self.grid: np.ndarray[(Any, Any), int]  # The first type hint is the shape, and the second one is the dtype.
